It turned out that the place you lived in was in danger, a serious disease had spreaded and killed thousands of people in one night! The government required people to stay at home at any course as well as closing school and company while researchers dealing with the disease. You decided to live in your basement so that you donâ€™t get an infection. Your task is to survive as long as possible!
