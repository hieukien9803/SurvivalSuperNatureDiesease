Plot:
You were sleeping on the couch while forgetting to turn the T.V off. Suddenly, the T.V switched the channel immediately, creating a high pitched sound like a siren. You woke up absentmindedly in the middle of the night as both your T.V and your phone rang with enormous noises. It turned out that the place you lived in was in danger, a serious disease had spreaded and killed thousands of people in one night! The government required people to stay at home at any course as well as closing school and company while researchers dealing with the disease. You decided to live in your basement so that you donâ€™t get an infection. Your task is to survive as long as possible!
Minimum viable product:
The game will consist of good graphics as the user interface. The game will have a menu, an introduction. The player will have an option to choose a character and each character has a different skill. The player will have an option to choose the amount of food and water bottle to survive within a scale. The player will also have an option to choose a specific item to bring to the basement (ex: phone, computer, clock, spray, etc) Each day survive will take a small amount of food as the program will keep track of the day. Last but not least, each day will have a scenario for the player to deal with.
